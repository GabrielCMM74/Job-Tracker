Allowing you to input information from the job posting and tailor each application you create. You are able to include a photo of the job description, your adapted resume, notes for each step in the process, and so much more. You are also able to meet your peers using this application and connect with them. You begin by signing up and creating your profile. After that you are able to add your Job application and all your user info is protected by Django Authentication. Utilizing PostgreSQL to manage user databases and AWS S3 bucket for user uploads.
